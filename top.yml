# entities defines for the following types:
#   1)'var':    variables that is used to save build arguments or intermediate variables,
#   could be be referenced by '$(variable name)';
#   2)'target': target for build command(make/ninja...);
#   3)'app':    applications that could be executed;
#   4)'lib':    libraries that could be linked to applications.

# system entities are defined in sys.yml, and MUST NOT be modified.

# customer variables
#
# example:
#
#   variable name:  # must be unique for all entities
#     type: var
#     desc: xxx # optional, description that is only for display
#     val:  xxx # value, that could be string , or reference to other variable

# customer targets
#
# example:
#
# target name:      # must be unique for all entities
